# DevOps Microservices Project ðŸš€

This project demonstrates a full DevOps pipeline using:
- Microservices in Node.js
- Dockerized services
- Kubernetes + Helm for orchestration
- CI/CD (can be extended with GitHub Actions / GitLab CI)
- Deployed on Minikube / AWS EC2

- `auth` â€“ handles authentication
- `payment` â€“ handles payment endpoints
- `user` â€“ (placeholder or to be implemented)

## ðŸ›  DevOps Stack
- **Docker**
- **Kubernetes** with `minikube`
- **Helm** for service packaging
- **AWS EC2 (Ubuntu)** as hosting environment

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Use Docker to build services
3. Use `helm install` to deploy charts to Minikube

```bash
helm install auth ./k8s/helm/charts/auth
helm install payment ./k8s/helm/charts/payment
